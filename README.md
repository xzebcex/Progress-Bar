## Contribution
Contributions to the program are much appreciated. While this program is completely functional, code contributions are always welcome. If you have any suggestions or improvements, you may contribute by forking the repository, making changes or additions to the code, and sending a pull request.

## Extra points
This program is intended to mimic a download process; however, it could also be modified to simulate other operations that need a progress indicator. You might, for example, change the application to replicate a file transfer or software installation.

## Conclusion
This app shows how to make a basic progress bar in Python. The time and random modules are used to mimic a download process, and the chr function is used to construct the progress bar. The application may be tweaked to replicate different procedures that necessitate the use of a progress indicator.
